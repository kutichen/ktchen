			 	The objective of content-based visual matching is to detect specific objects, which are most likely a local region compared to a whole frame. With the explosion of photos/videos, an image database can easily have millions or even billions of photos. Therefore, retrieving user desired photos or information has become a challenge. The goal of this project was to enable effective and efficient object retrieval over large-scale image databases with rich associated information for practical applications, such as landmark search for travel information; online store and auction product search; and painting and artwork search.
