			 	An intelligent vision-based vehicle system for person following was proposed. A target person who turns fast at a corner in a narrow path is tracked via use of crossroad points and image information taken by a robot arm. Techniques for intelligent interaction with humans to provide more intelligent services are also proposed, which can be employed to detect the facing direction and the hand movement of a person. Good experimental results show the flexibility and feasibility of the proposed methods for the application of indoor person following.
